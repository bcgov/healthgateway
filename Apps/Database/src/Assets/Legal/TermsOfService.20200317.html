<p>
    <p><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>
    The Service provides residents of British Columbia with access to their health information (<strong>"Health
        Information"</strong>). It allows users to, in one place, view their Health Information from various Provincial
    health information systems, empowering patients and their families to manage their health care.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Your use of the Service </strong></p>
<p>
    You may only access your own Health Information using the Service.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through this Service with others (e.g. with a family member
    or caregiver), you are responsible for all the actions they take with respect to the use of your Health Information.
</p>
<p>
    You must follow any additional terms and conditions made available to you in relation to the Service.

    Do not misuse the Service, for example by trying to access or use it using a method other than the interface and

    Service to you if you do not comply with these terms and conditions, or if we are investigating a suspected misuse
    of the Service.
