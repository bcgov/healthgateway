<p id="tos-1"><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>
<p>
    The Service provides you with a single point of access for viewing your BC
    health information and the BC health information of any dependents added to
    your account as described in section 2 of these Terms of Service (<strong
        >"Health Information"</strong
    >). The Health Information accessible through the Service includes
    information from Province information systems (<strong
        >"Province Information"</strong
    >) and Provincial Health Services Authority and regional health authorities'
    information systems (<strong>"Health Authority Information"</strong>).
</p>

<p id="tos-2"><strong>2. Access to Health Information</strong></p>
<p>
    In addition to your own Health Information, if you are the parent or
    guardian of a child under 12 you may access their Health Information by
    adding them to your account as a dependent. By adding a child under 12 as a
    dependent on your account, you confirm that you are their parent or guardian
    and you are authorized to access their Health Information. If for any reason
    you are no longer authorized to access the child's Health Information, you
    must remove the dependent from your account immediately. Once a child turns
    12, your access to their Health Information will be automatically disabled.
</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through the Service
    with others (e.g., with a family member, caregiver or healthcare provider),
    the Province is not responsible for any actions they take with the Health
    Information.
</p>

<p id="tos-3"><strong>3. Your Use of the Service</strong></p>
<p>
    You must not misuse the Service or try to access or use it in any way other
    than through the interface and instructions we provide. You may use the
    Service only as permitted by these Terms of Service and applicable law.
</p>
<p>We may suspend or stop providing the Service to you if:</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>you do not comply with these Terms of Service, or</li>
    <li>we are investigating a suspected misuse of the Service.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    We have the right, for any reason and at any time, to discontinue the
    Service or to modify the Service and/or these Terms of Service. Your
    continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any
    modifications to these Terms of Service.
</p>

<p>
    Using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
    rights in the Service or the Health Information you access through the
    Service. The Service, the Province Information and all associated
    intellectual property rights are owned by the Province, and the Health
    Authority Information is owned by the applicable health authority.
</p>

<p>You may:</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        use the Service as required to access the Health Information in
        accordance with these Terms of Service, and
    </li>
    <li>use the Health Information solely for personal health purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You must not use the Service or the Health Information for any other purpose
    other than the purposes set out in these Terms of Service. You must not
    remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary or legal notices displayed in
    connection with the Service or the Health Information.
</p>

<p id="tos-4">
    <strong>4. Third-Party Sites Accessed Through Health Gateway</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The Service may allow you to access certain third-party websites, such as
    health authority websites (<strong>"Third-Party Sites"</strong>) from within
    the Service interface. You understand and agree that:
</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>
        the Province does not control and is not responsible for the content,
        security, privacy practices, or performance of any Third-Party Sites or
        for any Health Information accessed from those Third-Party Sites,
    </li>
    <li>
        you are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable
        terms of use and/or privacy policies of any Third-Party Sites you access
        through the Service,
    </li>
    <li>
        without limiting any other provision of these Terms of Service, the
        Province disclaims all responsibility and liability for any data
        breaches, security incidents, or other issues that occur on Third-Party
        Sites, and
    </li>
    <li>
        you assume all risks associated with using Third-Party Sites and any
        Health Information accessed from those Third-Party Sites.
    </li>
</ol>

<p id="tos-5"><strong>5. Service Limitations</strong></p>
<p>
    The Health Information accessed through the Service is not a complete record
    of all your health care in BC.
</p>

<p>
    The Service is not intended to provide you with medical advice and does not
    replace care from qualified health professionals. If you have questions or
    concerns about your health, please contact your doctor or care provider.
</p>

<p id="tos-6"><strong>6. Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p>
    Your personal information is collected by the Ministry of Health under the
    authority of section 26(c) of the Freedom of Information and Protection of
    Privacy Act for the purpose of providing access to your Health Information.
    Your personal information such as name, BC Personal Health Number, cell
    number and email will be shared with the Provincial Health Services
    Authority and the regional health authorities as required to query and
    display your Health Information, as well as to send you notifications
    relating to your Health Information, such as reminders to book screening
    appointments or alerts that records relating to screening tests have been
    made available.
</p>

<p>
    The Service's notes and comments features allow you to enter your own
    private notes to record more information related to your health care. Use of
    this feature is voluntary. Any notes will be stored in the Service until you
    choose to remove them or delete your account. Any notes that you create can
    only be accessed by you.

<p id="tos-7"><strong>7. Privacy Protection Guidance</strong></p>
<p>
    The Province takes your privacy seriously. Although the Service includes
    security features, you must also take steps to protect your privacy:
</p>

<ol type="a">
    <li>
        Do not set up an account for the Service if you cannot fully control who
        has access to your device. If you share your phone or password with
        others, the security of your information is at risk. Anyone who has
        access to your device may be able to open your account and see your:
        <ul>
            <li>prescriptions, such as birth control medication,</li>
            <li>health visit and procedure details,</li>
            <li>vaccination status, and</li>
            <li>
                blood test results, including sexually transmitted infection
                testing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If you can't use the Service because you don't have your own secure
        device, we can tell you about other ways to access your Health
        Information. Email us at:
        <a href="mailto:HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca">HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Before setting up an account, make sure you have a password on your
        device that only you know. For tips on how to create a secure password,
        visit

        fingerprint identification.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure to log out of your account and close the screen once you are

</p>

<p id="tos-11"><strong>11. General</strong></p>
<p>
    These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and the Province
    with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Service. The headings
    in these Terms of Service are inserted for convenience only and will not be
    used in interpreting any provision of these Terms of Service. Sections 9, 10
    and any other provisions of these Terms of Service which, by their terms or
    nature, are intended to survive termination of your use of the Service will
    continue to apply even after your use of the Service ends. If any provision
    of these Terms of Service is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that
    provision will be severed from these Terms of Service and all other
    provisions will remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Service will
    be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of British
    Columbia and the applicable laws of Canada. By using the Service, you
    consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the
    province of British Columbia, sitting in Victoria, for the hearing of any
    dispute arising from or related to these Terms of Service and their subject
    matter.
