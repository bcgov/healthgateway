<p id="tos-5"><strong>5. Privacy Protection Guidance for Minors</strong></p>
<p>The below guidance is recommended for anyone under the age of 19.</p>
<p>
    Health Gateway takes your privacy seriously. Although Health Gateway
    includes security features, you must also take steps to protect your
    privacy:
</p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <p>
            Do not set up a Health Gateway account if you cannot fully control
            who has access to your device. If you share your phone or password
            with others, the security of your information is at risk. Anyone who
            has access to your device may be able to open your Health Gateway
            account and see your:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>prescriptions, such as birth control medication,</p></li>
            <li><p>health visit and procedure details,</p></li>
            <li><p>vaccination status, and</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    blood test results, including sexually transmitted infection
                    testing.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If you can’t use Health Gateway because you don’t have your own
            secure device, we can tell you about other ways to access the health
            information you need. Email us at:
            <a href="mailto:HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca">HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Before setting up a Health Gateway account, make sure you have a
            password on your device that only you know. For tips on how to
            create a secure password, visit
            <a

                https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins</a
            >. Or you can secure your device with facial recognition or
            fingerprint identification.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Make sure to log out of your account and close the screen once you
            are finished using Health Gateway. Lock and store your device
            securely when not in use.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you suspect your personal information has been viewed without
            your permission, please reach out to a trusted adult for help on
            what to do next. For more information, adults may go to

        >6. Attestation of Guardianship (Child under 12 years of age)</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    By providing the child’s name, date of birth, personal health number and
    date of COVID-19 test, I declare that I am the child’s guardian and that I
    have the authority to request and receive health information respecting the
    child from third parties.
</p>
<p>
    If I either: (a) cease to be guardian of this child; (b) or lose the right
    to request or receive health information from third parties respecting this
    child, I will remove them as a dependent under my Health Gateway account
    immediately.
</p>
<p>
    I understand that I will no longer be able to access my child’s COVID-19
    test results once they are 12 years of age.
</p>

<p id="tos-7"><strong>7. Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p id="tos-8"><strong>8. Limitation of Liabilities</strong></p>

    Under no circumstances will the Government of British Columbia be liable to
    any person or business entity for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
    consequential, or other damages based on any use of the Service or any
