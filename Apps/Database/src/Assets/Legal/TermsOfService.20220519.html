<p>
    The Service provides residents of British Columbia with access to their

    to, in one place, view their Health Information from various Provincial
    health information systems, empowering patients and their families to manage
    their health care.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Your use of the Service</strong></p>
<p>You may only access your own Health Information using the Service.</p>
<p>
    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through this Service
    with others (e.g. with a family member or caregiver), you are responsible
    for all the actions they take with respect to the use of your Health
    Information.
</p>
<p>

    method other than the interface and instructions we provide. You may use the
    Service only as permitted by law. We may suspend or stop providing the
    Service to you if you do not comply with these terms and conditions, or if
    we are investigating a suspected misuse of the Service.
</p>
<p>
    Using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property
    rights in the Service or the content you access. Don’t remove, obscure, or
    alter any legal notices displayed in connection with the Service.

<p><strong>4. Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p>
    Your personal information will be collected by the Health Gateway (Ministry
    of Health) and Service BC under the authority of section 26(c) of the
    Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for the purpose of
    providing access to your health records. Your personal information such as
    name, email and cell phone number will be shared with other public health
    service agencies to query your health information and notify you of updates.
    Your personal information will not be used or disclosed for any other
    purposes.
</p>
<p>
    The Service’s notes and comments features allow you to enter your own notes
    to provide more information related to your health care. Use of these
    features is entirely voluntary. Any notes will be stored in the Health
    Gateway until you choose to delete your account or remove specific notes.

<p><strong>5. Privacy Protection Guidance for Minors</strong></p>
<p>
    Health Gateway takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and will
    make sure that your information is secure in the Health Gateway portal,
    however you will also need to take steps to protect your information. There
    may be consequences to sharing your device with others, for example people
    may be able to open your Health Gateway account and see whether you are
    taking any prescriptions, such as birth control medication or whether you
    have a positive COVID-19 test result.
</p>
<p>Protect your privacy by doing the following:</p>
<p>
    It is not recommended that you download the BC Services Card app and set up
    a Health Gateway account if you cannot fully control who has access to your
    device. If you are unable to control who has access to your device, for
    example you do not own your phone or you share your phone or password with
    others, then the security of your information could be at risk. If this is a
    shared device, or one you do not fully control, there are other options to
    access your information. For example, to access your COVID-19 test results,
    please visit the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) website.
</p>
<p>
    Before downloading the BC Services Card app and setting up a Health Gateway
    account, make sure you have a secure password on your device that no one but
    you knows. For tips on how to create a secure password and password
    protection, please go to

        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins</a
    >.
</p>
<p>
    Make sure to log out of your account and close out of the screen once you
    are finished using the Health Gateway portal and lock and store your device
    securely when it is not in use.
</p>
<p>
    If you suspect your personal information has been viewed without your
    permission, please reach out to a trusted adult for help on what to do next.
    For more information, adults may go to
    <a
        href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/"
        >https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/</a
    >.
</p>
<p>
    Be suspicious of any unusual requests for your information. For example,
    Health Gateway will never ask you for any of your personal health
    information such as medical diagnosis.

<p><strong>6. Warranty Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>
    The Service and all of the information it contains are provided "as is"
    without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. All implied
    warranties, including, without limitation, implied warranties of
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, are
    hereby expressly disclaimed.
</p>
<p><strong>7. Attestation of Guardianship</strong></p>
<p>
    By providing the child’s name, date of birth, personal health number and
    date of COVID-19 test, I declare that I am the child’s legal guardian as per
    the Family Law Act, the Adoption Act and/or the Child, Family and Community
    Services Act, and am attesting that I have the authority to request and
    receive health information respecting the child from third parties.
</p>
<p>
    If I either: (a) cease to be guardian of this child; (b) or lose the right
    to request or receive health information from third parties respecting this
    child, I will remove them as a dependent under my Health Gateway account
    immediately.
</p>
<p>
    I understand that I will no longer be able to access my child’s COVID-19
    test results once they are 12 years of age. I understand it is a legal
    offence to falsely claim guardianship or access another individual’s
    personal health information without legal authority or consent.
</p>
<p><strong>8. Limitation of Liabilities</strong></p>
<p>
    Under no circumstances will the Government of British Columbia be liable to
    any person or business entity for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
    consequential, or other damages based on any use of the Service or any
    website or system to which this Service may be linked, including, without
    limitation, any lost profits, business interruption, or loss of programs or
    information, even if the Government of British Columbia has been
    specifically advised of the possibility of such damages.
</p>
<p><strong>9. About these Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
<p>
    We may modify these terms of service, or any additional terms that apply to
    the Service, at any time, for example to reflect changes to the law or
    changes to the Service. You should review these terms of service regularly.
    Changes to these terms of service will be effective immediately after they
    are posted. If you do not agree to any changes to these terms, you should
    discontinue your use of the Service immediately.
</p>
<p>
    If there is any conflict between these terms of service and any additional
    terms of service, the additional terms of service will prevail.
</p>
<p>
    These terms of service are governed by and to be construed in accordance
    with the laws of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable
    therein.
