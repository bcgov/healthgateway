Privacy Protection Guidance for Minors</strong></p>\n<p>\n    Health Gateway takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and will\n    make sure that your information is secure in the Health Gateway portal,\n    however you will also need to take steps to protect your information. There\n    may be consequences to sharing your device with others, for example people\n    may be able to open your Health Gateway account and see whether you are\n    taking any prescriptions, such as birth control medication or whether you\n    have a positive COVID-19 test result.\n</p>\n<p>Protect your privacy by doing the following:</p>\n<p>\n    It is not recommended that you download the BC Services Card app and set up\n    a Health Gateway account if you cannot fully control who has access to your\n    device. If you are unable to control who has access to your device, for\n    example you do not own your phone or you share your phone or password with\n    others, then the security of your information could be at risk. If this is a\n    shared device, or one you do not fully control, there are other options to\n    access your information. For example, to access your COVID-19 test results,\n    please visit the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) website.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Before downloading the BC Services Card app and setting up a Health Gateway\n    account, make sure you have a secure password on your device that no one but\n    you knows. For tips on how to create a secure password and password\n    protection, please go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins\"\n        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Make sure to log out of your account and close out of the screen once you\n    are finished using the Health Gateway portal and lock and store your device\n    securely when it is not in use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you suspect your personal information has been viewed without your\n    permission, please reach out to a trusted adult for help on what to do next.\n    For more information, adults may go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/\"\n        >https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Be suspicious of any unusual requests for your information. For example,\n    Health Gateway will never ask you for any of your personal health\n    information such as medical diagnosis.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For more tips on how to protect your privacy go to\n    <a href=\"https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/home\"\n        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/home</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you notice anything unusual in your account or have any privacy\n    questions, please contact the Health Gateway team below for help.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Email: <a href=\"mailto:HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca\">HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Attestation of Guardianship</strong></p>\n<p>\n    By providing the child’s name, date of birth, personal health number and\n    date of COVID-19 test, I declare that I am the child’s legal guardian as per\n    the Family Law Act, the Adoption Act and/or the Child, Family and Community\n    Services Act, and am attesting that I have the authority to request and\n    receive health information respecting the child from third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If I either: (a) cease to be guardian of this child; (b) or lose the right\n    to request or receive health information from third parties respecting this\n    child, I will remove them as a dependent under my Health Gateway account\n    immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I understand that I will no longer be able to access my child’s COVID-19\n    test results once they are 12 years of age.

Privacy Protection Guidance for Minors</strong></p>\n<p>\n    Health Gateway takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and will\n    make sure that your information is secure in the Health Gateway portal,\n    however you will also need to take steps to protect your information. There\n    may be consequences to sharing your device with others, for example people\n    may be able to open your Health Gateway account and see whether you are\n    taking any prescriptions, such as birth control medication or whether you\n    have a positive COVID-19 test result.\n</p>\n<p>Protect your privacy by doing the following:</p>\n<p>\n    It is not recommended that you download the BC Services Card app and set up\n    a Health Gateway account if you cannot fully control who has access to your\n    device. If you are unable to control who has access to your device, for\n    example you do not own your phone or you share your phone or password with\n    others, then the security of your information could be at risk. If this is a\n    shared device, or one you do not fully control, there are other options to\n    access your information. For example, to access your COVID-19 test results,\n    please visit the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) website.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Before downloading the BC Services Card app and setting up a Health Gateway\n    account, make sure you have a secure password on your device that no one but\n    you knows. For tips on how to create a secure password and password\n    protection, please go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins\"\n        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Make sure to log out of your account and close out of the screen once you\n    are finished using the Health Gateway portal and lock and store your device\n    securely when it is not in use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you suspect your personal information has been viewed without your\n    permission, please reach out to a trusted adult for help on what to do next.\n    For more information, adults may go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/\"\n        >https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Be suspicious of any unusual requests for your information. For example,\n    Health Gateway will never ask you for any of your personal health\n    information such as medical diagnosis.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For more tips on how to protect your privacy go to\n    <a href=\"https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/home\"\n        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/home</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you notice anything unusual in your account or have any privacy\n    questions, please contact the Health Gateway team below for help.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Email: <a href=\"mailto:HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca\">HealthGateway@gov.bc.ca</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong>6.

Attestation of Guardianship</strong></p>\n<p>\n    By providing the child’s name, date of birth, personal health number and\n    date of COVID-19 test, I declare that I am the child’s legal guardian as per\n    the Family Law Act, the Adoption Act and/or the Child, Family and Community\n    Services Act, and am attesting that I have the authority to request and\n    receive health information respecting the child from third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If I either: (a) cease to be guardian of this child; (b) or lose the right\n    to request or receive health information from third parties respecting this\n    child, I will remove them as a dependent under my Health Gateway account\n    immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I understand that I will no longer be able to access my child’s COVID-19\n    test results once they are 12 years of age. I understand it is a legal\n    offence to falsely claim guardianship or access another individual’s\n    personal health information without legal authority or consent.\n</p>\n<p><strong>8.
