You should\n    review these Terms of Service regularly. Changes to these Terms of Service\n    are effective immediately upon publication. If you do not agree to any\n    changes to these Terms of Service, you must discontinue your use of the\n    Service immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Note: Your login to the Service is managed by the BC Login Service\n    authentication service which is subject to its own Terms of Use, available\n    at\n    <a href=\"https://id.gov.bc.ca/static/termsOfUse.html\"\n        >BC Login Service Terms of Use</a\n    >.\n</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's covered in these Terms of Service:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-1\">The Health Gateway Service</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-2\">Access to Health Information</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-3\">Your Use of the Service</a></li>\n    <li>\n        <a href=\"#tos-4\">Third-Party Sites Accessed Through Health Gateway</a>\n    </li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-5\">Service Limitations</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-6\">Privacy Notice</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-7\">Privacy Protection Guidance</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-8\">Warranty Disclaimer</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-9\">Limitation of Liabilities</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-10\">Release</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#tos-11\">General</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"tos-1\"><strong>1. The Health Gateway Service</strong></p>\n<p>\n    The Service provides you with a single point of access for viewing your BC\n    health information and the BC health information of any dependents added to\n    your account as described in section 2 of these Terms of Service (<strong\n        >\"Health Information\"</strong\n    >). The Health Information accessible through the Service includes\n    information from Province information systems (<strong\n        >\"Province Information\"</strong\n    >) and Provincial Health Services Authority and regional health authorities'\n    information systems (<strong>\"Health Authority Information\"</strong>).\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"tos-2\"><strong>2. Access to Health Information</strong></p>\n<p>\n    In addition to your own Health Information, if you are the parent or\n    guardian of a child under 12 you may access their Health Information by\n    adding them to your account as a dependent. By adding a child under 12 as a\n    dependent on your account, you confirm that you are their parent or guardian\n    and you are authorized to access their Health Information. If for any reason\n    you are no longer authorized to access the child's Health Information, you\n    must remove the dependent from your account immediately. Once a child turns\n    12, your access to their Health Information will be automatically disabled.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you choose to share the Health Information accessed through the Service\n    with others (e.g., with a family member, caregiver or healthcare provider),\n    the Province is not responsible for any actions they take with the Health\n    Information.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"tos-3\"><strong>3. Your Use of the Service</strong></p>\n<p>\n    You must not misuse the Service or try to access or use it in any way other\n    than through the interface and instructions we provide. You may use the\n    Service only as permitted by these Terms of Service and applicable law.\n</p>\n<p>We may suspend or stop providing the Service to you if:</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>you do not comply with these Terms of Service, or</li>\n    <li>we are investigating a suspected misuse of the Service.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n    We have the right, for any reason and at any time, to discontinue the\n    Service or to modify the Service and/or these Terms of Service. Your\n    continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any\n    modifications to these Terms of Service.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Using the Service does not give you ownership of any intellectual property\n    rights in the Service or the Health Information you access through the\n    Service. The Service, the Province Information and all associated\n    intellectual property rights are owned by the Province, and the Health\n    Authority Information is owned by the applicable health authority.\n</p>\n\n<p>You may:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>\n        use the Service as required to access the Health Information in\n        accordance with these Terms of Service, and\n    </li>\n    <li>use the Health Information solely for personal health purposes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n    You must not use the Service or the Health Information for any other purpose\n    other than the purposes set out in these Terms of Service.

Third-Party Sites Accessed Through Health Gateway</strong>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    The Service may allow you to access certain third-party websites, such as\n    health authority websites (<strong>\"Third-Party Sites\"</strong>) from within\n    the Service interface. You understand and agree that:\n</p>\n\n<ol type=\"a\">\n    <li>\n        the Province does not control and is not responsible for the content,\n        security, privacy practices, or performance of any Third-Party Sites or\n        for any Health Information accessed from those Third-Party Sites,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        you are responsible for reviewing and complying with any applicable\n        terms of use and/or privacy policies of any Third-Party Sites you access\n        through the Service,\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        without limiting any other provision of these Terms of Service, the\n        Province disclaims all responsibility and liability for any data\n        breaches, security incidents, or other issues that occur on Third-Party\n        Sites, and\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        you assume all risks associated with using Third-Party Sites and any\n        Health Information accessed from those Third-Party Sites.\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p id=\"tos-5\"><strong>5. Service Limitations</strong></p>\n<p>\n    The Health Information accessed through the Service is not a complete record\n    of all your health care in BC.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    The Service is not intended to provide you with medical advice and does not\n    replace care from qualified health professionals.

Use of\n    this feature is voluntary. Any notes will be stored in the Service until you\n    choose to remove them or delete your account.
