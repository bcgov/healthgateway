Privacy Protection Guidance for Minors</strong></p>\n<p>\n    Health Gateway takes the protection of your privacy very seriously and will\n    make sure that your information is secure in the Health Gateway portal,\n    however you will also need to take steps to protect your information. There\n    may be consequences to sharing your device with others, for example people\n    may be able to open your Health Gateway account and see whether you are\n    taking any prescriptions, such as birth control medication or whether you\n    have a positive COVID-19 test result.\n</p>\n<p>Protect your privacy by doing the following:</p>\n<p>\n    It is not recommended that you download the BC Services Card app and set up\n    a Health Gateway account if you cannot fully control who has access to your\n    device. If you are unable to control who has access to your device, for\n    example you do not own your phone or you share your phone or password with\n    others, then the security of your information could be at risk. If this is a\n    shared device, or one you do not fully control, there are other options to\n    access your information. For example, to access your COVID-19 test results,\n    please visit the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) website.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Before downloading the BC Services Card app and setting up a Health Gateway\n    account, make sure you have a secure password on your device that no one but\n    you knows. For tips on how to create a secure password and password\n    protection, please go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins\"\n        >https://www.getcybersafe.gc.ca/en/secure-your-accounts/passphrases-passwords-and-pins</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Make sure to log out of your account and close out of the screen once you\n    are finished using the Health Gateway portal and lock and store your device\n    securely when it is not in use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you suspect your personal information has been viewed without your\n    permission, please reach out to a trusted adult for help on what to do next.\n    For more information, adults may go to\n    <a\n        href=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/\"\n        >https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/information-and-advice-for-individuals/privacy-and-kids/</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Be suspicious of any unusual requests for your information.

Attestation of Guardianship</strong></p>\n<p>\n    By providing the child’s name, date of birth, personal health number and\n    date of COVID-19 test, I declare that I am the child’s legal guardian as per\n    the Family Law Act, the Adoption Act and/or the Child, Family and Community\n    Services Act, and am attesting that I have the authority to request and\n    receive health information respecting the child from third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If I either: (a) cease to be guardian of this child; (b) or lose the right\n    to request or receive health information from third parties respecting this\n    child, I will remove them as a dependent under my Health Gateway account\n    immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I understand that I will no longer be able to access my child’s COVID-19\n    test results once they are 12 years of age.

Limitation of Liabilities</strong></p>\n<p>\n    Under no circumstances will the Government of British Columbia be liable to\n    any person or business entity for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\n    consequential, or other damages based on any use of the Service or any\n    website or system to which this Service may be linked, including, without\n    limitation, any lost profits, business interruption, or loss of programs or\n    information, even if the Government of British Columbia has been\n    specifically advised of the possibility of such damages.\n</p>\n<p><strong>9. About these Terms and Conditions</strong></p>\n<p>\n    We may modify these terms of service, or any additional terms that apply to\n    the Service, at any time, for example to reflect changes to the law or\n    changes to the Service. You should review these terms of service regularly.\n    Changes to these terms of service will be effective immediately after they\n    are posted. If you do not agree to any changes to these terms, you should\n    discontinue your use of the Service immediately.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If there is any conflict between these terms of service and any additional\n    terms of service, the additional terms of service will prevail.\n</p>\n<p>\n    These terms of service are governed by and to be construed in accordance\n    with the laws of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada applicable\n    therein.\n</p>\n", "System", new DateTime(2020, 12, 24, 0, 0, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Unspecified) });
