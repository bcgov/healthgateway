                                                only months and years with
                                                health records can be selected,

                                        We plan on developing a Patient Notes
                                        feature next, allowing users to add
                                        their own relevant health information.
                                        An updated Terms of Service will be
                                        released when the Patient Notes feature
                                        is ready. As mentioned above, Patient
                                        Notes will be deleted if a user chooses
                                        to close their account.
