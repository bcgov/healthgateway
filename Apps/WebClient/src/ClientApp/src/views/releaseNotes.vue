                    previous dispensed medication integration has now been
                    removed. Any associated technical debt is no longer
                    affecting Health Gateway.

                    As the Health Gateway could potentially display numerous
                    records for users, we improved the navigation from the month
                    calendar. You can now click on the icon on a specific date
                    and be taken to the list view for details.

                    page they are relevant to (Timeline and Profile).

                    The loading spinner was enhanced to convey to the user that

                    of medications in the PharmaNet system, as far back as 1996.
                    Due to system limitations, the Health Gateway returns up to
                    20,000 dispensed medication records.

                    - To close out our final sprint for Release 1.1, the Health
                    Gateway team ensured compliance with government security
                    standards as we transition to our enhanced medication

                    <strong>User Interface Enhancements</strong>
                    - As new functionality is continually developed, the
                    application menu was revamped to allow for easy navigation,
                    with features accessible from the menu. We also added a
                    pagination feature for those with large numbers of records.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User Support</strong> - To better support our users,
                    we added an email management feature which will allow the
                    Health Gateway team to resend emails, such as Beta Invites
                    for wait listed users. The feedback form has been updated to
                    allow users to provide feedback and have their questions
                    answered. When messages are sent through this contact form,
                    the Health Gateway team will be able to respond via email.

                    <strong>Enhanced Medications</strong>
                    - We have end to end functionality on our new medication
                    service, with the same look and feel, but for most users,
                    the list of dispensed medications will be more comprehensive
                    than the current 14 month view. This feature will be
                    finalized and deployed in the next sprint or two.

                <li>
                    <strong>New Feature: Timeline Filters </strong>- We built
                    filters for the health care timeline which allow you to
                    filter between Medications and Notes and any future data
                    sets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Printing</strong> - User feedback suggested that a
                    print function would support consultations, as patients
                    often have bring notes on paper to review with their care
                    providers during their appointments. This is the first
                    iteration of the print feature and produces printout of what
                    is displayed on the timeline. Users can select filters and
                    then print as needed.

                    <strong>New Feature: Patient Notes</strong>
                    - Based on early feedback and interviews, users expressed a
                    common desire to be able to add their own notes. In this
                    sprint, we are releasing the first iteration of Patient
                    Notes, a simple free text entry into the Health Care
                    Timeline. Users can add, edit and delete notes and if they
                    close their accounts, the notes are deleted from the
                    application.

                    <strong>Enhanced Medications</strong>

                    medication history, currently limited to 14 months. We
                    expect this enhanced medication list to be available in a
                    coming sprint.

                    <strong>Admin Dashboard Stats</strong>
                    - As more British Columbians register and start using the

                    support the growing number of users.

                    the Terms of Service has been updated. Users who are logging
                    in for the first time since the Terms of Service have been
                    updated will see a banner notifying them of the update when

                    We added a feature which allows users to close their Health
                    Gateway account from the profile page. If a user clicks on
                    the "Close My Account" link, their account will be
                    deactivated for 30 days, during which they can recover the
                    account. After 30 days has elapsed, the user's account and
                    personally entered information (once note feature is
                    implemented) will be removed permanently.

                Terms of Service will be released when the Patient Notes feature
                is ready. As mentioned above, Patient Notes will be deleted if a
                user chooses to close their account.
