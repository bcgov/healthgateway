                                and pharmacies in BC. However, immunizations

                                displayed as a dispensed medication rather than

                                results are available, you must add and verify

                                account. Most people do this step when they
                                register for their Health Gateway account. To

                                number, go to your Profile. You only need to do
                                this once.

                                BC Services Card (not a Care Card). To add a
                                dependent, type their full name exactly as it
                                appears on their BC Services Card, including any
                                middle names. If that doesn’t work, try other
                                slight variations of the name (e.g., put the
                                name in all capital letters, remove any hyphens,
                                or try different combinations of the given and
                                last names).
