## The Health Gateway for British Columbians
The goal of the healthgateway project is to develop a responsive design web application that empowers citizens with access and control over their health record. It enables a citizen to not only view and act on their health information, but also to connect it safely and security with third-party health care applications. 

## Objectives
**The short-term objectives of the project are:**

•	Deliver an adaptable first iteration of a patient centred platform, focussed on successfully delivering a secure, unified and coordinated gateway that provides patients a single view of their health information to start and over time will expand access to information, services and functionality. The gateway will develop or leverage existing capabilities of the Digital Health Strategy reference architecture, such as: 

  o	Establish a secure and seamless entry point to online health tools using a proven provincial asset (BC Services Card). 

  o	Establish a secure and trusted identity proofing mechanism which can be leveraged for future online engagement tools for both patients   and health care professionals.

  o	Where possible and feasible utilize existing capabilities (e.g. BC Services Card, HealthLink BC, MyGov platform) or create reusable       functional scope that can be leveraged by other initiatives within the Ministry, health sector and broader public sector to support         innovation and responsible use of resources.
  
•	Improve patient access to health information and available services.

**The long-term objectives of the project are:**

•	Empower patients by enabling access to their own health information when they want it.

•	Demonstrate cross-sector collaboration and successfully deliver a meaningful and coordinated online experience.

•	Support meaningful and relevant discussion at the time of care between patients and care team members. 

•	Promote an integrated system of care by reducing information barriers.

•	Increase patient trust and confidence in the health care system and its ability to modernize.
