Redis has been deployed to OpenShift

You will need to initialize the cluster:

Take note of the pod IP addresses from:
oc get pods -l app=redis -o wide

Go into OpenShift terminal on one of the redis pods and run:

redis-cli --cluster create [IP1:6379] [IP2:6379] [IP3:6379]

Validate cluster
redis-cli --cluster check redis
