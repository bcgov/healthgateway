Redis has been deployed to OpenShift

You will need to initialize the cluster:

Take note of the pod IP addresses from:
oc get pods -l app=redis -o wide

Go into OpenShift terminal on redis-0 pod and run:

redis-cli --cluster create [IP1:6379] ... [IP6:6379] --cluster-replicas 1

Validate cluster
redis-cli --cluster check redis:6379
