# Patroni Postgres

## Installation

Process the template patroni.yaml in Openshift, the parameters are self explanatory, populate them as needed. 

The objects created include:
    1) Stateful Set Patroni-postgres containing 3 pods.
    2) Master service (eg patroni-postgres-master)
        Points to the elected master pod, which contains the transactional 
        database (selector is application=patroni-postgres, cluster-name=patroni-postgres, role=master).
    3) Replica service (eg patroni-postgres-replica)
        Points to the replica pods, which contains the read-only database, 
        we are currently configured for 2 replica pods (selector is application=patroni-postgres, cluster-name=patroni-postgres, role=replica).
    4) Service account "patroni" with a role binding to the "patroni" role.
    5) Volumes for each of the pods (5gb default).
    6) Config map that stores the current master pod (patroni-postgres-leader).
    7) Config map that stores the database configuration like "max_connections" (patroni-postgres-config).
    8) Secret containing username and password.

## Initial Configuration

Connect to the database as postgres user and execute the following:

```bash
CREATE ROLE gateway WITH
  LOGIN
  INHERIT
  NOCREATEDB
  NOCREATEROLE
  PASSWORD 'UPDATEME';

CREATE DATABASE gateway WITH
  OWNER = gateway
  ENCODING = 'UTF8'
  LC_COLLATE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
  LC_CTYPE = 'en_US.UTF-8'
  TABLESPACE = pg_default
  CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
  TEMPLATE template0;

ALTER DATABASE gateway OWNER TO gateway;
```

Connect to the database as postgres but set the maintenance DB to gateway and execute

```bash
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER to gateway;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Identifying the master node

Using the UI:
Navigate to Services > patroni-postgres-master
This service should be listing the current master node.

Using the command line:

``` bash
oc get pods -l role=master
```
or

``` bash
oc describe configmaps patroni-postgres-leader;
```

### Connection to the database 

The connection requires a port tunnel from the pod in openshift to the local computer,
use the following command to create a tunnel:

``` bash
oc port-forward <pod-name> <local-port>:5432
```

example:

``` bash
oc port-forward patroni-postgres-1 5432:5432
```

Use pgadmin or psql to connect to server: localhost:5432, username and password defined in the secrets.


### Manual switch of master pod

Updates the configmap that stores the current leader node (master),
The script below sets the leader to node 2:

``` bash
oc annotate configmaps patroni-postgres-leader leader=patroni-postgres-2 --overwrite=true;
```

## Restore Backup Script

Backups are generated daily by the dc "backup" in the production realm and are composed by a SQL script containing the database structure + data.

To restore the backup follow these steps:

1) Connect to openshift using the terminal/bash and set the project to the production one.
2) Download the backup file to your local computer using the command below:

``` bash
oc rsync <backup-pod-name>:/backups/daily/<date> <local-folder>
```

This copies the folder from the pod to the local folder.

3) Extract backup script using gzip:

``` bash
gzip -d <file-name>
```

4) Connect to the master database pod using port-forward (See 'Connection to the Database').

5) Manually create the database:

``` bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -c 'create database gateway;'
```

6) Execute the script to restore the database:

``` bash
psql -h localhost -d gateway -U postgres -p 5432 -a -q -f <path-to-file>
```

## Delete Database (Cleanup)

1) Drop all current connections:

``` bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -c "select pg_terminate_backend(pid) from pg_stat_activity where datname='gateway';"
```

2) Drop Database:

``` bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -c 'drop database gateway;'
```

3) Create Database:

``` bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -c 'create database gateway;'
```

4) Run Migrations Scripts

## Edit Patroni configuration using Rest API

1) Connect the terminal to any of the patroni pods running using remote shell:

``` bash
oc rsh patroni-postgres-1
```

2) Update config (e.g. postgresql.parameters.max_connections to 100):

``` bash
curl -s -XPATCH -d '{"postgresql":{"parameters":{"max_connections":100}}}' http://localhost:8008/config | jq .
```

3) Restart Cluster:

``` bash
patronictl restart patroni-postgres
```

Other) Get/View the current config:

``` bash
curl -s localhost:8008/config | jq .
```
