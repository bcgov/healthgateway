## Smoke Testing

## Load Testing

  > Load testing is primarily concerned with assessing the systems performance, the purpose of stress testing is to assess the availability and stability of the system under heavy load.

## Stress Testing

  > Stress Testing is a type of load testing used to determine the limits of the system. The purpose of this test is to verify the stability and reliability of the system under extreme conditions.

## Spike Testing

  > Spike testing is a type of stress testing that immediately overwhelms the system with an extreme surge of load.

## Soak Testing

  > While load testing is primarily concerned with performance assessment, and stress testing is concerned with system stability under extreme conditions, soak testing is concerned with reliability over a long time. The soak test uncovers performance and reliability issues stemming from a system being under pressure for an extended period.
