The reviewer should then:

    Confirm by reading all sections below.

1. Confirm the merge branch

    A normal feature/bug branch should merge into the Dev branch.  Exceptions for hotfix and sprint merges do occur and the target would then be Master.

        The code commits should reflect the documented description and nothing more.  If additional changes are included the reviewer should call these out and request that the developer document the changes in Azure and in the description or remove the changed code.
